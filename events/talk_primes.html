            Howdy Fellas!
            <br>
            <br>
            Ever wondered how mathematicians delve into prime numbers and bare integers using weird-looking abstract functions over the real numbers? Wonder no more, for we have Prof. Ravi Raghunathan from the Department of Mathematics, IIT Bombay, to speak about prime numbers and the questions which guided the study of number theory for our latest talk :)
            <br>
            <br>
            Abstract: The two fundamental theorems about prime numbers are the following.
            1. Every natural number can be written uniquely (up to a permutation) as a product of prime numbers
            2. There are infinitely many primes.
            <br>
            <br>
            I shall explain how attempts to refine the questions above have led to many of the developments of modern number theory.

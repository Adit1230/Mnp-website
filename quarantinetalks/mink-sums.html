                What are closed convex sets? How do curves and width correlate? What are these to do with Minkowski sums? How does the Barbier theorem unfold the beauty of convex sets?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Arya Vadnere gave a wonderful talk as a brief introduction to convex geometry. He started with an introduction to curves, support lines, width of a curve and Minkowski sums.He later discussed curves of constant width; followed by Barbier’s theorem and its proof. It was an amusing topic for those interested in pure mathematics and we had an overwhelming number of participants! At the end, Arya mentioned the applications of Barbier’s theorem to solve Buffon’s needle problem. Here is the link to the slides used in the presentation 
                <i>Arya Vadnere is a student at the Chennai Mathematical Institute</i>
